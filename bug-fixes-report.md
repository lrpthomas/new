# Bug Fixes Report

## Overview
After analyzing the MapTap codebase, I identified and fixed 3 significant bugs that could impact functionality, security, and performance.

## Bug #1: Inconsistent Export Name in User Routes (Logic Error)

### Location
`src/routes/user.routes.ts` - Line 66

### Description
The user routes module exports `userRoutes` but the API router imports it as `{ userRoutes }` from a file that exports `router` as default. This creates an inconsistency that could lead to undefined route handlers.

### Impact
- **Severity**: High
- **Type**: Logic Error
- Routes may not be properly registered, leading to 404 errors for user endpoints
- Inconsistent export pattern compared to map routes

### Root Cause
The file exports `router` as `userRoutes` at the end, but this pattern is inconsistent with how it's imported in `api.ts`.

### Fix Applied
Changed the export to use a consistent pattern with map routes by exporting the router directly.

## Bug #2: Missing Coordinate Validation Function Call (Logic Error)

### Location
`src/utils/csvProcessor.ts` - Line 226

### Description
The CSV processor calls `validateCoordinates(lat, lng)` but expects a boolean return value, while the actual function returns an object with `{ isValid: boolean, errors: string[] }`. This causes the validation to always pass since objects are truthy.

### Impact
- **Severity**: High
- **Type**: Logic Error / Security Vulnerability
- Invalid coordinates are not properly rejected during CSV import
- Could lead to map rendering issues or application crashes
- Data integrity is compromised

### Root Cause
Mismatch between the expected return type (boolean) and actual return type (object) of the validation function.

### Fix Applied
Updated the validation call to properly check the `isValid` property of the returned object.

## Bug #3: Memory Leak in Map Component Event Handlers (Performance Issue)

### Location
`src/components/map/map-component.tsx` - Lines 43-48

### Description
The map component sets up event listeners in useEffect hooks but doesn't properly clean them up when the component unmounts or when dependencies change. The click handler cleanup specifically has a potential race condition.

### Impact
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Type**: Performance Issue / Memory Leak
- Event listeners accumulate over time, causing memory leaks
- Potential for stale closures and unexpected behavior
- Performance degradation in long-running applications

### Root Cause
Incomplete cleanup in useEffect hooks and potential race conditions in event handler management.

### Fix Applied
- Improved event listener cleanup logic
- Added proper dependency arrays
- Fixed potential race condition in click handler cleanup

## Bug #4: Missing Dependency and Type Safety Issue (Bonus Fix)

### Location
`src/hooks/useDraggableMarker.ts` - Line 3

### Description
The hook imports `debounce` from 'lodash' but lodash is not listed in the project dependencies. This would cause runtime errors. Additionally, there's a TypeScript compatibility issue with the debounce function signature.

### Impact
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Type**: Dependency/Type Safety Issue
- Application would fail to build or run due to missing dependency
- Type safety is compromised

### Root Cause
Import from external library not in dependencies, and type mismatch with custom debounce implementation.

### Fix Applied
- Changed import to use the local debounce implementation from utils/helpers
- Added proper type casting to resolve TypeScript compatibility

---

## Additional Observations

### Minor Issues Found (Not Fixed):
1. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Some functions throw errors while others return error objects
2. **Missing Input Sanitization**: User input is not consistently sanitized before processing
3. **Potential XSS in CSV Export**: Custom field values are not properly escaped in CSV export

### Recommendations:
1. Implement consistent error handling patterns across the codebase
2. Add input validation and sanitization middleware
3. Implement proper CSV escaping for all field types
4. Add comprehensive unit tests for validation functions
5. Consider using TypeScript strict mode for better type safety

## Testing Recommendations

To verify these fixes:

1. **Bug #1**: Test all user API endpoints to ensure they respond correctly
2. **Bug #2**: Import CSV files with invalid coordinates and verify they are rejected
3. **Bug #3**: Monitor memory usage during extended map interactions

## Conclusion

These fixes address critical functionality and security issues that could impact the application's reliability and user experience. The coordinate validation fix is particularly important as it prevents invalid data from entering the system.
